Contributions to Simpletask are appreciated. However to set the expectations:

- There is **NO** guarantee that a PR will be merged.
- There is **NO** guarantee that a PR will be reviewed.

_Making a donation doesn't change the points above._

Simpletask is a hobby for me and as such I cannot commit to any amount of time invested.
I also have strong opinions on what I think Simpletask should look like and where it should move to.

To prevent wasting a lot of your own time, **DO**:

- Discuss changes you would like to make in a enhancement issue.
- Look into open issues to see if there is something which has already been discussed and you could implement
- Join the gitter channel to discuss any plans you have.

Or if you find the above nonsense:

- Keep your own fork of Simpletask and merge anything you like :) .
